This makes sense, as those from 20 to 50 make up the majority of the full-time workforce. The top of the plot is sparce, however this is likely due to the fact that not many people work 75 to 100 hours per week. Similarly, the right side is sparce, which is most likely due to the retirement of people over the age of 60. Overall, there is some evidence that working hours per week will decrease with age, but this is likely due to retirement.\n",

Points classified as a yearly income of less than 50K are quite spread out across the plot, showing that those classified as <=50K can work more hours than those classified as >50K, and still make less yearly income. Overall, there is little evidence that age or working hours per week can classify yearly income.\n",

There is also evidence that those with higher capital gains have a higher yearly income, greater than 50 000 USD per year. "
