    "There is evidence that those in the greater than 50K income category experience more capital gains than those in the <=50K category, as the red and blue points are distinctively separated into the income categories on our Age vs. Capital Gains plot. Alternatively, our Age vs. Capital Losses plot has a mixed distribution of red and blue points across the plot, showing a weak separation of the income categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Age appears to have no affect on the amount of capital gains or losses in each income category.\n",

    "2. Working Hours per Week vs. Capital Gains & Working Hours per Week vs. Capital Losses\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, there is a separation of the income categories in our Working Hours per Week vs. Capital Gains plot, but not in our Working Hours per Week vs. Capital Losses plot. This shows that capital gains are higher for those in the >50K income category, than the <=50K income category. There is little evidence that working hours per week affects the yearly income category classification.\n",

    "3. Age vs. Working Hours per Week\n",
    "This scatterplot is crowed in the center, with people under 50 working in the 40 to 50 hours per week range. This makes sense, as those from 20 to 50 make up the majority of the full-time workforce. The top of the plot is sparce, however this is likely due to the fact that not many people work 75 to 100 hours per week. Similarly, the right side is sparce, which is most likely due to the retirement of people over the age of 60. Overall, there is some evidence that working hours per week will decrease with age, but only due to retirement from the workforce. \n",
    "\n",
    "Points with a great than 50K income classification are somewhat clustered in the centre of the graph around 50 working hours per week, however this is distributed evenly across our age range. Points classified as a yearly income of less than 50K are quite spread out across the plot, showing that those classified as <=50K can work more hours than those classified as >50K, and still make less yearly income. Overall, there is little evidence that age or working hours per week can classify yearly income.\n",

    "After plotting and testing our predictor variables of interest (Capital Gains, Capital Losses, Working Hours per Week, Age), there is sufficient evidence that Capital Gains can be used to classify yearly income. There is also evidence that those with higher capital gains have a higher yearly income, greater than 50 000 USD per year. "
